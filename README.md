# Data-Structures-Graphs
Working with directed and undirected graph data structures utilizing adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations with Python. 

The two files in the repository demonstrate Python and data structure knowledge. The d_graph file utilizes an adjacency matrix to represent a directed and weighted graph. The ud_graph file utilizes an adjacency list to represent an undirected and unweighted graph. In both files, common graph operations are performed (adding and deleting vertices/edges, finding paths and cycles, and performing BFS/DFS searches). Example problems are given at the end.
